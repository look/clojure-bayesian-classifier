# Bayesian Classifier in Clojure

This is a port of the Python code from
[Programming Collective Intelligence](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do)
to Clojure 1.1 circa November 2009. I wrote it to learn a bit about
Clojure. I'm not sure if it's any good but it seems to work OK. 

I gave a talk at [MinneBar 4](http://wiki.minnestar.org/wiki/MinneBar_4) about 
[my experiences learning Clojure](http://www.recursion.org/clojure-for-newbs/) that
stemmed from this project.
